## Overview

I am starting be confortable using CSS, but I still have a little difficult naming the classes, so in this project I started to use BEM(a nomenclature pattern) to see if this helps me. Overrall I think I'm improving and my challenges are starting to get more close to the desing proposed.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
